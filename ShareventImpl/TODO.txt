- refactor integration tests for new domain model
- extend integration tests to better cover new domain model
- integrate S3 for imageDBService

### DONE ###
- implement proper asynchronous update after upload --> has been added twice befoe because there were 2 divs with the targeted name
- make sure no overlapping in mongo (clear before, after application restart) --> synchronization with mongo in bootstrap
- display 'empty gallery' -> displaying 'empty gallery' message in the incognito-user's gallery
- asynchronous image loading needs also to work for the first images of the gallery -> the box for the incognito user needs to be always available. Once more users are allowed, this will require some more thought.
- display loading gif onimagesubmit -> image was missing. added from original plugin sources
- display error message onimagesubmitfailed -> using JSONResponse.success == false; showing error image
